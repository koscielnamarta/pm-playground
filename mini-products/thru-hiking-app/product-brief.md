# Thru-Hiking App — Product Brief

## Problem
Long-distance hikers often complete trails over weeks or months.
Existing tools focus on single activities and lack:
- aggregated progress tracking
- clear visualization of completed vs remaining trail
- lightweight stats across multiple hikes

## Target users
- Thru-hikers
- Section hikers
- Outdoor enthusiasts tracking long trails over time

## Value proposition
A simple web app that allows hikers to:
- upload GPX tracks
- visualize progress along a predefined trail
- see cumulative distance & completion stats

## MVP scope
- Single predefined trail
- GPX import
- Progress visualization on a map
- Basic statistics
- No social features

## Non-goals (for MVP)
- Social feeds
- Gamification
- Advanced route planning
