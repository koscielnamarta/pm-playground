# AI Feasibility & Assumptions — AI Tarot App

## What the AI must be able to do
- Identify tarot cards from an image
- Understand card positions within a spread
- Generate a holistic interpretation across cards
- Adapt tone to reflective, non-deterministic guidance

## What the AI does NOT need to do
- Predict concrete future events
- Be factually “correct”
- Replace human intuition
- Provide advice in regulated domains

## Key assumptions (must be validated)
- Tarot cards can be reliably identified from photos
- Card orientation (upright/reversed) can be detected or inferred
- Users accept AI as a reflective companion, not authority
- Minor misidentifications do not destroy user trust

## Biggest unknowns / risks
- Image quality and lighting variability
- Different tarot deck designs
- Hallucinations framed as certainty
- Over-interpretation by users

## Possible mitigation strategies
- Limit supported decks in MVP
- Ask user to confirm detected cards
- Use cautious, suggestive language
- Explicit disclaimers in UX copy
