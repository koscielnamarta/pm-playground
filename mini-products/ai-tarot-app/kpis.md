# MVP Validation Plan — AI Tarot App

## Core validation questions
1. Do users understand and trust AI-generated spread interpretations?
2. Does holistic interpretation add value beyond card-by-card meanings?
3. Are users willing to use AI as a reflective companion?

## Validation signals (what success looks like)
- Users complete the full flow without guidance
- Users report that interpretations feel relevant or insightful
- Users compare AI output with their own intuition (not blindly follow it)

## Early warning signals (what failure looks like)
- Confusion about AI output
- Users treat interpretations as literal predictions
- Low willingness to repeat the experience

## Lightweight validation methods (PoC)
- Manual spread photo analysis (Wizard-of-Oz)
- Qualitative user feedback after interpretation
- Short reflection questions after use
